These processes differ and are utilized for different scenarios and purposes. The following section will share further examples of how to utilize the sale, auth, capture, refund and credit payment types within the Payment API.\n\n### Transaction Retrieval API\n#### Webhooks\nWebhooks allow merchants to receive next-to-real-time notifications of events happening on their account. While the Query API lets integrators “pull” information from the gateway, webhooks “push” information to the integrator.\n\n#### Query API\nThe Query API allows merchants to download a detailed stream of transaction data. This dataset can then be used to create in-house reports and analytics.\n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication is done via API Security Key that is assigned to your merchant account. This key is used to authenticate the request and must be kept secret. New keys can be generated from the merchant control panel in Settings > Security Keys.\n\nAPI Security Key needs to be present as part of the URL query parameters with parameter name being: `security_key`.\n\n# Transaction Types\n\n| Transaction Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sale              | Transaction sales are submitted and immediately flagged for settlement.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Authorization     | Transaction authorizations are authorized immediately but are not flagged for settlement. These transactions must be flagged for settlement using the capture transaction type.                                                |\n| Capture           | Transaction captures flag existing authorizations for settlement. Only authorizations can be captured. Captures can be submitted for an amount equal to or less than the original authorization.                               |\n| Void              | Transaction voids will cancel an existing sale or captured authorization. In addition, non-captured authorizations can be voided to prevent any future capture. Voids can only occur if the transaction has not been settled.  |\n| Refund            | Transaction refunds will reverse a previously settled or pending settlement transaction. If the transaction has not been settled, a transaction void can also reverse it.                                                      |\n| Credit            | Transaction credits apply an amount to the cardholder's card that was not originally processed through the Gateway. In most situations credits are disabled as transaction refunds should be used instead.                     |\n| Validate          | This action is used for doing an \"Account Verification\" on the cardholder's credit card without actually doing an authorization.                                                                                               |\n| Update            | Transaction updates can be used to update previous transactions with specific order information, such as a tracking number and shipping carrier.                                                                               |\n\n\n# Transaction Testing Methods\n\n## Method 1: Put your account in test mode\nTransactions can be submitted to any merchant account that is in test mode. Keep in mind that if an account is in test mode, all valid credit cards will be approved but no charges will actually be processed and nothing will be sent to the credit card or ACH processor.\n\n## Method 2: Send in a one-off test transaction\nOne-off test transactions can be processed using the below test_mode variable. This will process this singular transaction in test mode, but it will not impact anything else on the account. An example use case would be running test transactions in a developent environment while your website is actively processing real transactions from customers.\n\n`test_mode`: If set to \"enabled\" and providing one of the test credit card numbers listed below with \"1025\" as the expiration date, the single transaction will process in test mode. To see this transaction in reporting, you will need to toggle your account to test mode, but the Payment API testing can be done without doing this.\n\n## Method 3: Dedicated test account\nThe Payment Gateway Demo Account can be used for testing at any time. Please use the below security key for testing with this account. This account is always available and allows testing in a completely sandboxed environment. Like all testing methods, no card or check data will ever be sent for actual processing.\n\n`security_key` = `6457Thfj624V5r7WUwc5v6a68Zsd6YEm`\n\n## Test Data\n<details>\n<summary>Transactions can be submitted using the following information:</summary>\n\n| Card Type         | Number               |\n|:------------------|:---------------------|\n| Visa              | 4111111111111111     |\n| MasterCard        | 5431111111111111     |\n| Discover          | 6011601160116611     |\n| American Express  | 341111111111111      |\n| Diner's Club      | 30205252489926       |\n| JCB               | 3541963594572595     |\n| Maestro           | 6799990100000000019  |\n\n| Other Details           | Value      |\n|:------------------------|:-----------|\n| Credit Card Expiration  | 10/25      |\n| Account (ACH)           | 123123123  |\n| Routing (ACH)           | 123123123  |\n\n</details>\n\n## Triggering Errors in Test Mode\nTo cause a declined message, pass an amount less than 1.00.\n\nTo trigger a fatal error message, pass an invalid card number.\n\nTo simulate an AVS match, pass 888 in the address1 field, 77777 for zip.\n\nTo simulate a CVV match, pass 999 in the cvv field.\n\n# WebHooks\nBefore anything else, you need to have a URL endpoint set up to receive POST requests. This will be a server location that you control and can use to process webhook messages as they are delivered.\n\n## Where To Setup\nFrom the Settings > Webhooks page, click the “Add Endpoint” button.\n\n## How to Setup\nEnter your webhook receiver URL and select all event types you would like to be notified of from the list. As soon as the URL is saved, you will start to receive events at the URL specified; there is no further setup required. Please note that all URLs must start with “https” and have valid TLS encryption enabled.\n\n## How to Validate\nThe Webhooks settings page shows your webhooks signing key. This value should be used on your website to authenticate that it is the gateway delivering these messages and not a third party.\n\nHere is an example implementation in PHP:\n\n```php\n  function webhookIsVerified($webhookBody, $signingKey, $nonce, $sig) {\n    return $sig === hash_hmac(\"sha256\", $nonce . \".\" . $webhookBody, $signingKey);\n  }\n\n  try {\n    $signingKey = \"YOUR_SIGNING_KEY_HERE\";\n    $webhookBody = file_get_contents(\"php://input\");\n    $headers = getallheaders();\n    $sigHeader = $headers['Webhook-Signature'];\n\n    if (!is_null($sigHeader) && strlen($sigHeader) < 1) {\n      throw new Exception(\"invalid webhook - signature header missing\");\n    }\n\n    if (preg_match('/t=(.*),s=(.*)/', $sigHeader, $matches)) {\n      $nonce = $matches[1];\n      $signature = $matches[2];\n    } else {\n      throw new Exception(\"unrecognized webhook signature format\");\n    }\n\n    if (!webhookIsVerified($webhookBody, $signingKey, $nonce, $signature)) {\n      throw new Exception(\"invalid webhook - invalid signature, cannot verify sender\");\n    }\n\n    // webhook is now verified to have been sent by us, continue processing\n\n    echo \"webhook is verified\";\n    $webhook = json_decode($webhookBody);\n    var_export($webhook);\n  } catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"error: $e\\n\";\n  }\n```\n                \n## IP Addresses\nWebhooks will only be delivered from the following IP addresses. It is advisable to limit your webhook endpoints to only receive requests originating from these addresses:\n\n104.192.32.81 through 104.192.32.87\n\n104.192.36.81 through 104.192.36.87\n\n## Retry Logic\n\nIf we try to deliver a webhook notification to your endpoint and do not get an `HTTP 200` response, the gateway will reattempt delivery up to 20 times. Over the course of 3 days we will keep trying until a success response is received. If no success response is received in this time period the notification will stop attempting and will not be delivered.\n\nThe approximate interval between delivery retires is currently:\n\n- 1 attempt 15 seconds after the initial attempt\n- 3 attempts every 60 seconds\n- 1 attempt 5 minutes later\n- 1 attempt 15 minutes later\n- 1 attempt 30 minutes later\n- 10 attempts every hour\n- 2 attempts every 12 hours\n- 1 final attempt after 24 more hours\n\nYour application should not rely on this specific retry schedule, as the retry timing may change in the future.\n\nThe retry schedule may also change based on current circumstances. For example, if there are a large number of pending notifications for your endpoint, we may significantly reduce the number of retry attempts for that endpoint until the backlog is cleared.\n\n\n# Appendixes\n\n## Payment API - Response Codes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Response Code Table</summary>\n\n| Code  | Description                                                        |\n|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 100   | Transaction was approved.                                          |\n| 200   | Transaction was declined by processor.                             |\n| 201   | Do not honor.                                                      |\n| 202   | Insufficient funds.                                                |\n| 203   | Over limit.                                                        |\n| 204   | Transaction not allowed.                                           |\n| 220   | Incorrect payment information.                                     |\n| 221   | No such card issuer.                                               |\n| 222   | No card number on file with issuer.                                |\n| 223   | Expired card.                                                      |\n| 224   | Invalid expiration date.                                           |\n| 225   | Invalid card security code.                                        |\n| 226   | Invalid PIN.                                                       |\n| 240   | Call issuer for further information.                               |\n| 250   | Pick up card.                                                      |\n| 251   | Lost card.                                                         |\n| 252   | Stolen card.                                                       |\n| 253   | Fraudulent card.                                                   |\n| 260   | Declined with further instructions available.

Rate Limits\n\n\nIn order to ensure the platform is available for everyone, in very rare cases, some users may encounter rate limits.\nIf your request rate exceeds the limit, you may receive one of two responses: the Payment API-specific Rate Limit response, or the System-Wide Rate Limit response.\n\n### Payment API-Specific Rate Limit\nIf you exceed the Payment API rate limit, you will receive a response with the following fields:\n\n| Property       | Value                |\n|:---------------|:---------------------|\n| response       | 3                    |\n| responsetext   | Rate limit exceeded  |\n| response_code  | 301                  |\n\nExample Response\n```\nresponse=3&responsetext=Rate limit exceeded&authcode=&transactionid=&avsresponse=&cvvresponse=&orderid=&type=&response_code=301\n```\n\n### System-Wide Rate Limit\n\nYou may encounter the system-wide rate limit if you are using other services,\nfor example if you are making requests to both the Payment API and the Query API,\nor if there are too many concurrent connections from your IP.\nIn this case, your request will receive `HTTP 429: Too Many Requests`\n\n### Handling Rate Limit Responses\nWait before retrying\n\nIf you receive a `response_code of 301` or an `HTTP 429 response`, do not immediately retry the request.\nImmediately retrying may increase the delay before transactions are allowed again.\n\nUse fewer simultaneous connections\nReduce the number of threads or processes sending connections if you regularly encounter rate limits.\n\nCheck your credentials\nRepeated authentication failures from your IP may result in temporarily lowered rate limits.\n\nContact support\nIf you've tried the above fixes and still need additional help, contact Customer Support for other options.\n\n## Payment API -

        "description": "> ❗️ Never Use Real API Keys\n> \n> Never use real API Keys when testing. The gateway allows Partners to create Test Merchant Accounts. Testing should always use keys from the Test Accounts and never keys from a Standard Account.\n<details>\n<summary>Methodology</summary>\n\n**Steps:**\n1. The customer sends their payment information to the merchant's web site.\n2. The merchant web site posts the payment data to the Payment Gateway.\n3. The Payment Gateway responds immediately with the results of the transactions.\n4. The merchant web site displays the appropriate message to the customer.\n\nThe communication method used to send messages to the Payment Gateway's server is the standard HTTP protocol over an SSL connection.\n\nIn the Payment API method, the communications with the cardholder (Steps 1 and 4) are developed completely by the merchant and therefore are not defined by the Payment Gateway. Step 1 should simply collect the payment data from the cardholder and Step 4 should display the appropriate transaction receipt or declined message.\n\nIn Step 2, transaction details should be delivered to the Payment Gateway using the POST method with the appropriate variables defined below posted along with the request.\n\nIn Step 3, the transaction responses are returned in the body of the HTTP response in a query string name/value format delimited by ampersands. For example: `variable1=value1&variable2=value2&variable3=value3`\n\n### Customer Vault\nThe Customer Vault was designed specifically for businesses of any size to address concerns about handling customer payment information. Visa and MasterCard have instituted the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security to protect cardholder data, wherever it resides, ensuring that members, merchants, and service providers maintain the highest information security standards.\n\nThese associations have also deemed that merchants will be held liable for any breach of cardholder data. This has become a major concern for merchants who handle credit card or electronic check payments. The Customer Vault is designed for these merchants who desire to avoid the tremendous costs and resources involved in becoming PCI compliant under these circumstances.\n\nThe Customer Vault does this by allowing merchants to transmit their payment information through a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection for storage in our Level 1 PCI certified data facility. Once the customer record has been securely transmitted to the Customer Vault, the merchant can then initiate transactions remotely without having to access cardholder information directly. This process is accomplished without the merchant storing the customer's payment information in their local database or payment application.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see invoice related notes</summary>\n\n**Update Invoice**\n\nAll variables (besides currency) on an invoice may be updated.\nUpdating an invoice will not result in a new invoice being sent to the customer.\n\n**Send Invoice**\n\nTo send the invoice after updating an invoice, use the send_invoice request after making changes.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Response Code Table</summary>\n\n| Code  | Description                                                        |\n|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 100   | Transaction was approved.                                          |\n| 200   | Transaction was declined by processor.                             |\n| 201   | Do not honor.                                                      |\n| 202   | Insufficient funds.                                                |\n| 203   | Over limit.                                                        |\n| 204   | Transaction not allowed.                                           |\n| 220   | Incorrect payment information.                                     |\n| 221   | No such card issuer.                                               |\n| 222   | No card number on file with issuer.                                |\n| 223   | Expired card.                                                      |\n| 224   | Invalid expiration date.                                           |\n| 225   | Invalid card security code.                                        |\n| 226   | Invalid PIN.                                                       |\n| 240   | Call issuer for further information.                               |\n| 250   | Pick up card.                                                      |\n| 251   | Lost card.                                                         |\n| 252   | Stolen card.                                                       |\n| 253   | Fraudulent card.                                                   |\n| 260   | Declined with further instructions available.

        "description": "> ❗️ Never Use Real API Keys\n>\n> Never use real API Keys when testing. The gateway allows Partners to create Test Merchant Accounts. Testing should always use keys from the Test Accounts and never keys from a Standard Account.\n<details>\n<summary>Methodology</summary>\n\n**Overview**\n\nWhile our online reporting interface allows merchants to quickly and easily retrieve detailed information about past transactions, a need for additional flexibility may be required. For example, a merchant may have custom accounting software that requires up-to-date information about the settlement status of all credit card transactions every day.\n\nThis document describes how developers can query our reporting engine directly to retrieve transaction reports in a machine readable format. Once the data has been retrieved, it can then be parsed and imported into a variety of software applications.\n\n**Communication**\n\nThe communication protocol used to send messages to the Payment Gateway is through the HTTP protocol over an SSL connection (HTTPS). The format you must use is name/value pairs delimited by ampersand.\n\n| URL                                     | Example Post Data                                     |\n|:----------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|\n| `https://secure.nmi.com/api/query.php`  | `security_key=security_key&transaction_id=123456789`  |\n\nYou should POST your request to the Query API. The name/value pairs that are accepted by the Payment Gateway can be found in the 'Variables' section of this API.\n\nThe Query API can be tested with live credentials or a dedicated test account only. Please contact your Merchant Service Provider for more information.\n\nThe Query API will respond in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example

The `serviceId` value can be acquired using the `/api/v4/services/search` [documented here](checkservices).\n\nAs seen in the response, value-added services are technically “processors” so they return many values that you also see when adding a credit card processor, but most of this is not useful info for VAS. Important values here include:\n* `id` is the unique identifier for this instance of the service\n* `serviceId` is the code name for the service\n* `status` will show “pending” until the merchant agrees to the fees/TOS, then it will be “active”\n* `condition` will always be “offered” even after the merchant signs up\n\n### Request to Make Service Offered\nThe only real difference is that in the response the `status` is now “inactive”.\n</details>",

You can pull the correct agreement language with a `/merchants/{id}/agreement_text` request. This will return the id and language that you are agreeing to.\n</details>",
